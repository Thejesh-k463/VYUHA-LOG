# Changelog

All notable changes to Vyuha are tracked here. Versions are kept in sync across
`package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and the sidebar
footer via `npm run bump-version <version>`.

## v2.70.0
- **Preset playbooks expanded to a categorized global library — 25 setups
  across 7 trading ecosystems** (was 10, flat): Intraday & Momentum (ORB, VWAP,
  Gap-and-Go, Momentum/RS), Breakout & Trend (MA Pullback, Retest,
  Donchian/Turtle, 52-Week-High, Darvas Box), Positional/Growth (CANSLIM,
  Minervini VCP, Wyckoff Spring, Weinstein Stage 2), Mean Reversion (Range
  Fade, Connors RSI-2, Bollinger Reversion), Price Action/SMC (ICT Liquidity
  Sweep + FVG, Supply & Demand, Pin Bar), Options & Events (Theta Decay, Iron
  Condor, India Expiry-Day Theta, Earnings/Event), and Swing & Overnight
  (Multi-Day Swing, India BTST). The New Playbook picker groups them by
  ecosystem; every rule's metrics (risk %, ATR multiples, deltas, stop %)
  remain fully editable before saving, and the from-scratch custom flow is
  unchanged. New `tests/preset-playbooks.test.ts` guards the library's shape
  (unique names, ≥3 single-line rules each, ≥5 categories). Verified live:
  picked CANSLIM, edited O'Neil's 7–8% stop rule to a custom 5% before saving,
  confirmed it persisted, then cleaned up.

## v2.65.0
- **Fixed: open short positions (written options, short futures) showed qty=0/
  invested=0/unrealised=0 on the Equity and Trade F&O trackers.**
  `deriveOpenPositions()` (`lib/analytics/positions.ts`) computed
  `qty = max(0, buyQty − sellQty)` and used `avgBuyPrice` unconditionally — for
  a sell-to-open position (buyQty=0, sellQty=open qty), both evaluated to 0. Now
  isShort-aware (`sellQty > buyQty`), matching the pattern already used by
  `/risk` and `closePosition`: qty/entry read off the sell leg, unrealised P&L
  mirrors direction (profits when price falls), and days-held measures from the
  sell date (the actual open leg) for a short. MTF is long-only in India, so
  its own-capital/funded-amount fields are unaffected. New `tests/positions.test.ts`
  (7 tests: long, short profit/loss, days-held, R-multiple sign, MTF untouched).
  Verified live: a disposable open short stock-option (entry 100, MTM 80, qty
  75) correctly showed invested ₹7,500 / unrealised +₹1,500 (20%) where it
  previously showed all zeros — then removed.

## v2.60.0
- **Fixed: Edit-trade dialog showed a false loss for open MTF positions.** The
  dialog never wired up the current-price field to the P&L preview, so a
  position up in price could still show "Net: -₹X" (only realized gross, always
  ₹0 pre-exit). It now shows entry cost so far and unrealized P&L (at current
  price) as separate, clearly-labeled figures for any still-open position.
- **New: Current R and Target R:R shown side by side.** Current R stays live
  (unrealised P&L ÷ risk amount, tracks the position as it moves); Target R:R is
  new — the static planned reward:risk from entry/SL/target, computed once at
  entry. Both appear on the trades table, trackers, and edit/add trade dialogs.
- **MTF own-margin % is now broker-specific, not one flat global rate.**
  `margin_config` gained a `broker` column (Dhan/Groww 25%, Zerodha 20%, per
  each broker's own MTF documentation) — threaded through position tracking,
  the accrual job, close/edit/create trade flows, the Trade Calculator, the
  broker-cost comparison report, and the /risk margin-rate editor (now one row
  per broker × segment, independently editable).
- **New: funding-type filter on the equity tracker** — All / User-funded only /
  Broker-funded (MTF) — to separate self-funded delivery positions from
  leveraged MTF ones at a glance.
- **New: Risk Amount auto-computes from the SL you set** (`|entry − SL| × qty`)
  in both the Add-trade and Edit-trade forms, while still allowing a manual
  override.
- **New: preset playbooks library** — 10 globally-recognized trading setups
  (Opening Range Breakout, VWAP reversion, trend-following, breakout-pullback,
  mean-reversion, gap-and-go, momentum, options theta-decay, earnings play,
  multi-day swing) selectable from the New Playbook dialog to pre-fill the form;
  edit anything before saving. The from-scratch custom-playbook flow is
  unchanged.
- Verified live end-to-end (broker-specific margin math, the false-loss fix,
  auto risk-amount, funding filter, preset playbooks) against a disposable test
  trade and playbook, cleaned up afterward. 393 unit tests, typecheck, lint all
  green.

## v2.50.0
- **Fixed: capital figures frozen at the original ₹13L/₹4L defaults.** Page titles,
  Cash & Ledger, and bucket-filter dropdowns had "(₹13L)"/"(₹4L)" hardcoded into
  `BUCKET_LABELS` — changing capital in Settings never touched them (now removed;
  live capital already shows correctly elsewhere on each page). A second instance of
  the same bug: the Targets → Equity position-size calculator divided by a
  hardcoded 1,300,000 instead of live `equityCapital` — now threaded through as a
  prop from the server page.
- **Fixed: R-multiple frozen at trade creation for open positions.** The tracker
  showed a value computed once when a trade was opened (net entry-cost ÷ risk),
  never updated as the position moved — a position up 1.43% could show a negative
  R. `lib/analytics/positions.ts#deriveOpenPositions` now computes R live as
  unrealised P&L ÷ risk amount.
- **Fixed: a second "MTF funded = full position value" bug**, this time in the
  position-tracker's own display logic (`positions.ts`), independent of the
  backend fix from v2.0.0 — it was silently ignoring the persisted funded amount
  and recomputing the (wrong) full-value figure for display.
- **Fixed: MTF interest day-count undercounted by one day, in three places** —
  close-trade, the daily accrual job, and broker-cost comparison all subtracted an
  extra day. Confirmed against Dhan's own MTF documentation: interest runs from
  T+1 settlement through the day before sale proceeds settle, i.e. exactly
  (sellDate − buyDate) calendar days — no "-1".
- **Corrected Zerodha's seeded pledge/unpledge fee** from ₹20 to the real ₹15+GST
  per Zerodha's own MTF calculator page. Every other rate (Dhan's interest tiers,
  Zerodha/Groww annual rates, STT/stamp/exchange/SEBI/DP) already reconciled
  exactly against a real user-supplied MTF trade log.
- **MTF input model switched to "Own capital used" as primary** (matching how a
  real MTF trade log is kept — you know what cash you put in; the broker-financed
  amount and leverage are derived), replacing the old "funded amount" field in
  both the trade form and the Trade Calculator.
- **New: close any open trade** — a "Close position" action with a live
  recomputed charges/P&L preview before confirming, for any segment (equity,
  MTF, options, futures).
- **New: edit any trade, any time** — a full editor (qty, prices, dates, SL/TSL/
  target, risk, MTF own-capital, tags, notes) for open or closed trades, reusing
  the same charges engine so edits never drift from what a fresh entry would
  compute.
- **New MTF analytics on the position tracker**: own capital deployed, ROI on
  capital % (the leveraged return your own cash actually earned), breakeven sell
  price, and a warning badge when accrued interest has eaten the entire unrealised
  gain — modeled directly on a real trader-maintained MTF log.
- Verified live end-to-end against real test positions (created, tracked, closed,
  edited, then removed) plus the existing 252-trade journal, which is untouched.
  387 unit tests, typecheck, lint and production build all green.

## v2.0.0
- **Fixed: MTF interest overcharged everywhere (real money bug).** Trade creation, the
  daily accrual job, position-close, and the Trade Calculator's default all treated an
  MTF position as 100% broker-financed — interest should only accrue on the leveraged
  portion your broker actually lends, not the full position value. New
  `defaultMtfFundedAmount()` (`lib/risk/margin.ts`, 4 tests) derives the funded amount
  from the existing configurable own-margin % (Settings → Margin, same rate the /risk
  margin gauge uses); a new `trades.mtf_funded_amount_paise` column persists it per
  trade at entry so the accrual job and close-position recompute reuse the correct
  figure instead of silently resetting to the full buy value. The live charge preview
  now applies the identical default, so what you see before saving matches what's
  saved (it previously skipped MTF interest AND the pledge charge whenever "MTF
  funded" was left blank). Verified live: a ₹1L test MTF position correctly funded at
  ₹75,000, not ₹1,00,000 — roughly 25% less interest than the old bug charged.
- **Fixed: open-trade preview showed a false loss when price was up.** The "Add open
  trade" panel only ever displayed realized P&L (always ₹0 gross pre-exit), so a
  position up in price still read as a net loss from entry charges alone. Now shows
  "Entry cost so far" (charges only) and, when a current price is entered, a separate
  "Unrealized P&L (at current price)" line — clearly not merged into the cost figure.
  Closed-trade preview is unchanged.
- Removed the "Days held (MTF)" field from the open-trade form (interest can't have
  accrued on day zero); kept for closed manual entries where an elapsed holding period
  is meaningful. Trade Calculator's "Funded ₹ (0 = full)" relabeled to "0 = auto @
  {margin}%".

## v1.50.0
- **Pre-trade limits are now advisory — the trader always has final say.** A breached
  limit no longer disables the Add-trade button: the verdict reads "Limit breached
  (you can override)" and the button flips to a red "Override & add anyway". Overridden
  breaches are still recorded in `rule_violations` and surface on the Discipline
  scorecard's breach tile — control stays with the user, accountability stays in the
  journal.
- **"Active" bucket renamed to "Trade F&O" everywhere in the UI** — nav ("Trade F&O
  Tracker", "Targets — Trade F&O"), page titles, dashboard/trades bucket filters, risk
  cockpit scope toggle, margin gauge, capital settings, cash ledger, capital-growth
  chart. Display-only: the internal bucket id stays `active` (DB rows, APIs and
  overrides are untouched). New `BUCKET_SHORT_LABELS` in `lib/domain/constants.ts`.

## v1.40.0
- **P0.1 paise migration FINISHED** — all 17 ₹-amount columns on `trades` (values, P&L,
  full charge breakdown, risk amount) now stored as INTEGER paise (migrations `0016`/`0017`,
  data converted ×100 in place and verified sum-identical on all 252 trades). A Drizzle
  `customType` exposes rupees at runtime, so no call sites changed. Per-unit price/level
  columns (avg prices, SL/TSL/target, strike, FMV) stay REAL by design.
- **Margin/SPAN tracking** (P1.2 final slice) — pure `lib/risk/margin.ts` (7 tests): long
  options = premium paid; short options = rate% × notional (spot ?? strike); futures/intraday
  = rate% × current value; MTF/delivery = rate% × invested. New editable `margin_config`
  rate table (migration `0018`, seeded approximations) + "Margin estimate" panel with
  per-bucket utilisation gauges on /risk.
- **IND-5 AIS / Form 26AS reconciliation** — pure `lib/analytics/ais.ts` (8 tests): tolerant
  paste parser (dividend / sale SFT-18 / purchase SFT-17 / interest; FY labels or dates;
  ₹-grouped amounts) + reconciliation of AIS dividends (per company+FY, alias-resolved,
  incl. TDS) and per-FY sale/purchase consideration (trades + IPO allotments/exits) with
  matched / MISMATCH / not-in-journal / not-in-AIS statuses, tolerance max(₹10, 0.5%).
  New /reports/ais screen (nav "AIS Reconcile"), stateless `/api/ais`.
- **P2.1 broker-API auto-import (Kite slice)** — first `ApiImportSource` implementation:
  `lib/import/api/kite.ts` (5 tests) pulls today's executions from Zerodha Kite Connect,
  aggregates per symbol+product (earliest-buy/latest-sell dates, MIS→intraday, CNC→delivery,
  MTF→mtf hints) and feeds the unchanged preview→commit pipeline. "Connect broker" card on
  /import; credentials in new `broker_connections` table (migration `0020`, plaintext local,
  stated in UI; Kite tokens expire daily).
- **Trade attachments** (P2.4 completion) — chart screenshots per trade: `trade_attachments`
  table (migration `0019`) + files under `<data-dir>/attachments/`, upload/gallery/delete in
  the journal dialog, streaming via `/api/trades/attachments` (images only, 8 MB cap,
  path-confined, audited). Backup screen notes attachments are outside the JSON backup.
- **MAE/MFE per trade** — pure `lib/analytics/mae-mfe.ts` (5 tests) computes max adverse /
  favorable excursion + %-of-MFE captured from `price_history` EOD bars for closed dated
  trades; card with coverage badges on /reports/edge.
- **Discipline breach tile** (P1.4 follow-up) — `breachReport()` in discipline.ts (4 tests)
  rolls up `rule_violations` saved at entry time; "Entry-time limit breaches" card on
  /reports/discipline showing per-rule counts and closed net P&L.
- **Zero-dependency installer** — `build-desktop.mjs` now bundles the building machine's
  Node runtime (+ LICENSE) into `desktop-dist/node/`; the Tauri shell prefers the bundled
  binary and falls back to system `node` for older bundles. Target machines no longer need
  Node installed (cargo check verified; rebuild the installer to ship it).

## v1.10.0
- Option Greeks: Black-Scholes delta/gamma/theta/vega per open option position + a
  portfolio aggregator (`lib/analytics/greeks.ts`), scaled by quantity and signed for
  direction (short flips gamma/vega negative, theta positive). New `trades.implied_vol`
  column, settable per position via the risk-edit dialog; falls back to a flat 20%
  estimate when unset. New "Option Greeks" panel on Portfolio Risk.

## v1.9.0
- F&O trade entry upgrade: an Equity/F&O mode toggle in the manual trade form —
  Underlying, Option/Future, Strike, CE/PE, Direction (Buy/Sell), Expiry with a live
  DTE badge, Lot size, Lots, Entry/Exit premium, Strategy.
- Short (sell-to-open) position support fixed across the app: `isOpen` detection,
  the risk/exposure engine, the close/cover flow, and the pre-trade risk-edit routes
  were long-only; a written CE/PE was previously invisible to portfolio risk.
- Real sector data (via an external market-data lookup) populated for held positions,
  correcting earlier manual-entry mistakes in the instruments master.

## v1.8.0
- P1.3 market-data foundation: `instruments` security master (symbol/sector/ISIN/lot
  size) and `price_history` (EOD OHLC, built automatically from bhavcopy imports).
- Sector concentration panel on Portfolio Risk (HHI, top-sector %, classified %).

## v1.7.0
- P1.1 finished: time-weighted return (TWR) and benchmark alpha/beta vs an index
  (NIFTY), completing the performance analytics suite alongside the existing
  Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar/XIRR.
- P1.4 pre-trade limits engine: per-trade risk cap, daily-loss stop, max-open,
  max-trades/day, and concentration checks — live pass/warn/block before saving a
  trade, plus a what-if panel on Portfolio Risk.

## v1.6.0
- Version-sync-only bump (no feature).

## v1.5.0 and earlier
- Foundational build: money-as-paise core, cash/fund-flow ledger, append-only audit
  log, backup/restore, quant performance analytics (Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar/XIRR),
  option strategy recognition + payoff diagrams, physical-settlement tracker,
  F&O ban/ASM surveillance, tax-loss harvesting, advance-tax planner, broker-cost
  comparison, bhavcopy auto-MTM, symbol-alias map, and the trade calculator.
  See `docs/INSTITUTIONAL_GRADE_ROADMAP.md` for full detail on each.
