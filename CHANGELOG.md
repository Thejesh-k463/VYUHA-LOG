# Changelog

All notable changes to Vyuha are tracked here. Versions are kept in sync across
`package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and the sidebar
footer via `npm run bump-version <version>`.

## v2.84.0
Two fixes aimed at discoverability: numbers that explain themselves, and the
preset playbooks that were hiding inside a dropdown.

- **Clickable KPI cards with a drill-down popup.** Sixteen cards across the
  Dashboard, Portfolio Risk, Equity Tracker and Trade F&O Tracker now lift and
  glow on hover and open a compact breakdown on click (or Enter/Space — the
  cards are keyboard-focusable `role="button"`s). The popups answer *what is
  this number made of*, not just what it is: **Net P&L** splits into gross minus
  every charge with best/worst day and dates; **Open Risk @ SL** puts open risk
  next to initial risk with the stopped/unstopped count, so trailing a stop
  visibly moves the number; **MTF funded** shows effective leverage and interest
  accrued as a share of your paper gain, flagging when financing has eaten the
  entire unrealised gain; **Unrealised P&L** names your best and worst position.
  Detail objects are plain serializable strings, so server components can build
  them without a client boundary.
- **Preset library on `/playbooks`.** The 25 world-class setups existed since
  earlier releases but lived inside a `<select>` in the New Playbook dialog —
  effectively invisible. They now render as a browsable library: filter chips
  for 7 ecosystems (Intraday & Momentum, Breakout & Trend, Positional/Growth,
  Mean Reversion, Price Action/SMC, Options & Events, Swing & Overnight), every
  rule visible on the card, one-click **Add**, `✓ Added` once it's yours, and
  fully editable afterwards. Deliberately **not** auto-seeded into the DB: 25
  untraded setups would bury your real playbooks and turn the Discipline page's
  per-playbook expectancy into 25 rows of noise. Nothing is added until you
  click. The empty state now points at the library.

## v2.82.0
Ecosystem-research batch: findings from surveying the global journal market
(TradeZella/TraderSync/Edgewonk/TradesViz) and India's 2024–2026 F&O regime,
turned into three shipped features.

- **Angel One + Upstox importers.** Angel One alone is ~15% of India's active
  trading accounts; both brokers now import end-to-end. One resilient parser
  handles each broker's *two* export shapes — tradebook (buy/sell column,
  aggregated into round-trips per tradingsymbol+product) and aggregated P&L
  report — with candidate-list column resolution plus contains-fallback, so
  header drift between report versions doesn't break parsing. `₹` symbols and
  thousands-commas are stripped. Charge cards, DP charges, MTF interest and
  eq_mtf own-margin seeded for both. Two hardcoded broker enums (charges-preview
  route, trade actions) now derive from `BROKERS`, so they can never silently
  reject a newly added broker again.
- **SEBI Compliance Radar** (`/risk`). Turns your open book + today's date into
  plain warnings for the post-2024 regime: **+2% expiry-day ELM on short options
  expiring today**, **no calendar-spread margin benefit on expiry day**, weekly
  expiry discontinuation (BANKNIFTY/FINNIFTY/MIDCPNIFTY/NIFTYNXT50 are monthly
  only; NIFTY on NSE and SENSEX on BSE kept weeklies), index position-limit
  proximity vs the ₹1,500 cr net limit with the intraday random-snapshot
  warning, and standing reminders on upfront premium collection and the
  ₹15–20 lakh contract band. Informational only — your broker's RMS remains the
  source of truth and Vyuha never blocks a trade.
- **Shareable stat cards** (`/reports/performance`). Privacy-first by
  construction: defaults to **% of capital**, offers "hide ₹ entirely", and
  shows real rupees only if explicitly chosen; you pick which of 10 metrics
  appear. The PNG is drawn on a canvas and saved **locally — nothing is
  uploaded** — and carries a permanent, non-editable *"self-reported from my own
  journal · not broker-verified"* watermark, because an offline app must never
  imply broker verification.
- Note: options payoff diagrams were already shipped (strategies engine +
  payoff chart) — verified rather than rebuilt.

468 unit tests (+28), typecheck, lint all green; every feature verified live,
including a temporarily-shorted expiring option to prove the radar fires and an
end-to-end PNG export.

## v2.80.0
Three workstreams: performance, monetization v2, and a full visual overhaul.

### Performance & code health
- **Per-request query deduplication**: the eight hottest server queries
  (trades, MTM/spot maps, settings, margin config, aliases, playbooks, charge
  rates) are wrapped in React `cache()` — pages that previously hit the DB 2–4×
  per render now hit it once, and importing a broker file no longer re-queries
  margin config per trade (the last N+1).
- **New indexes** on `trades.is_open` and `trades.playbook_id` (migration 0024).
- **Lint: 16 warnings → 0 problems** — dead imports/locals removed across 12
  files; `_`-prefixed/rest-sibling destructures now treated as intentional.

### Monetization v2 (offline, user-first)
- **14-day full-Pro trial** stamped on the true first run (installer templates
  ship unstamped; existing installs backfilled). Trial users see everything
  plus an honest countdown strip.
- **`<ProGate>`** now drives all four Pro screens (Portfolio Risk, Tax Summary,
  ITR Pack, Broker Costs) from one `PRO_FEATURES` registry. "banner" mode
  (current) informs; "block" mode replaces content with an upsell panel after
  the trial. Enforced product principle: the core journal — trades, imports,
  dashboard, playbooks, backups — is NEVER gated.
- **Annual keys**: the license payload takes a signed optional `expires` date;
  `license-issue.mjs --years 1` mints them; expired keys degrade gracefully
  (grace trial → free) with a renewal notice. Settings shows tier/trial/expiry.

### Visual overhaul (all 3 cosmetic tiers)
- **Typography**: Inter UI + JetBrains Mono on every number and table
  (self-hosted, offline-safe) — the terminal look, app-wide.
- **Depth**: elevation tokens with inner-highlight cards, hover lift, blurred
  dialog overlays with real spring keyframes, hero gradient border + glow on
  the equity curve.
- **Charts**: draw-in animation + crosshair cursor on the equity curve; the
  P&L calendar gained rounded magnitude-scaled cells, hover scale and a today
  ring.
- **Alive layer**: Net P&L sparkline + week-over-week ▲/▼ delta chip, count-up
  KPI numbers (reduced-motion aware), row-hover lift on every table, shimmer
  skeletons on the five heaviest routes, and a dependency-free **toast system**
  replacing inline "Saved." messages.
- **Sidebar**: collapsible icon rail (persisted), accent rail + glow on the
  active item, a "Jump to… Ctrl K" chip wired to the command palette, and a
  footer **IST clock with market open/closed pulse dot**.
- **Accent skins**: Terminal (teal) / Tape (amber) / Ice (blue), selectable in
  Settings with instant preview, persisted (migration 0025), composing with
  light theme + colorblind mode. P&L semantics untouched by skins.
- **Illustrated empty states** (skin-aware line art) on every data table, the
  dashboard charts and the Playbooks page.
- **Branded splash** (glowing व, ripple halo, shimmer progress, privacy
  footer) and **print-grade PDF output**: printing forces the light palette,
  strips elevation, sets page margins and keeps tables from splitting.

440 unit tests, typecheck, lint all green; features verified live in dark,
light and Tape-skin contexts, including a fresh-context toast/interactivity
probe.

## v2.75.0
User-control release: seven upgrades, every one warns and cautions instead of
acting — the trader keeps the final say on everything.

- **Playbook rule-checklist enforcement.** Journaling a trade with a playbook
  attached now shows its rules as a "tick what you actually followed"
  checklist; unticked rules persist as violations (validated server-side
  against the playbook's real rules, merged non-destructively with the
  pre-trade limits engine's entry breaches). New Discipline table: **"Playbook
  rules — what breaking each one costs"** (worst rule first, closed net ₹,
  avg/trade) with honest correlation-≠-causation framing.
- **Per-playbook expectancy cards.** Each playbook card shows Trades / Win% /
  Net / Expectancy / Profit Factor / Avg R from closed tagged trades, with a
  ⚠ small-sample warning under 20 trades and an honest empty state.
- **Auto-updater surfaced.** The launch-time update check (native Update
  now/Later dialog, signed releases, offline-silent) now has an "App updates"
  card in Settings documenting the consent contract: nothing ever installs on
  its own, and the DB is backed up before any migration.
- **MAE/MFE stop-tuning report** (Edge page). MAE/MFE now normalizes to R via
  each trade's recorded risk; the new card shows winners' heat distribution
  (≥0.5R / ≥0.8R) and losers running past 1.1R (flagged as behavioral, not
  placement). Every suggestion is hedged; small samples get an explicit
  "mostly noise" warning; footer says descriptive-not-prescriptive.
- **EOD bhavcopy auto-MTM (opt-in).** New Settings toggle — OFF by default —
  lets the app fetch NSE's EOD file once per trading day (after ~7pm IST) and
  mark open equity positions to close via the existing audited pipeline.
  Warns that matched MTM prices get overwritten; skips silently offline;
  walks back weekdays past holidays. Migration 0023 adds the settings columns.
- **SL/TSL/target breach alerts.** New pure detector (long/short aware, TSL
  supersedes SL) feeding caution banners on Dashboard and Portfolio Risk:
  "check a live quote and review your exit plan" — marks are EOD/manual, and
  the banner never places or closes anything. Desktop notifications are
  strictly opt-in per device.
- **ITR Pack (India)** — new report: per-FY head segregation (speculative
  intraday / non-speculative F&O / STCG-LTCG), ICAI Guidance Note (8th ed.)
  turnover, and a 44AB audit verdict with layered cautions (44AD's 5-year
  lock, loss carry-forward deadline, "have a CA confirm" on every verdict).
  CSV/XLSX export for the CA.

Verified live end-to-end (rule checklist → per-rule cost table, expectancy
cards, stop-tuning card, breach banner via a temporary SL, auto-MTM refusing
to run while disabled, ITR pack against the real 252-trade book) with all
test data reverted. 433 unit tests (+30), typecheck, lint all green.

## v2.70.0
- **Preset playbooks expanded to a categorized global library — 25 setups
  across 7 trading ecosystems** (was 10, flat): Intraday & Momentum (ORB, VWAP,
  Gap-and-Go, Momentum/RS), Breakout & Trend (MA Pullback, Retest,
  Donchian/Turtle, 52-Week-High, Darvas Box), Positional/Growth (CANSLIM,
  Minervini VCP, Wyckoff Spring, Weinstein Stage 2), Mean Reversion (Range
  Fade, Connors RSI-2, Bollinger Reversion), Price Action/SMC (ICT Liquidity
  Sweep + FVG, Supply & Demand, Pin Bar), Options & Events (Theta Decay, Iron
  Condor, India Expiry-Day Theta, Earnings/Event), and Swing & Overnight
  (Multi-Day Swing, India BTST). The New Playbook picker groups them by
  ecosystem; every rule's metrics (risk %, ATR multiples, deltas, stop %)
  remain fully editable before saving, and the from-scratch custom flow is
  unchanged. New `tests/preset-playbooks.test.ts` guards the library's shape
  (unique names, ≥3 single-line rules each, ≥5 categories). Verified live:
  picked CANSLIM, edited O'Neil's 7–8% stop rule to a custom 5% before saving,
  confirmed it persisted, then cleaned up.

## v2.65.0
- **Fixed: open short positions (written options, short futures) showed qty=0/
  invested=0/unrealised=0 on the Equity and Trade F&O trackers.**
  `deriveOpenPositions()` (`lib/analytics/positions.ts`) computed
  `qty = max(0, buyQty − sellQty)` and used `avgBuyPrice` unconditionally — for
  a sell-to-open position (buyQty=0, sellQty=open qty), both evaluated to 0. Now
  isShort-aware (`sellQty > buyQty`), matching the pattern already used by
  `/risk` and `closePosition`: qty/entry read off the sell leg, unrealised P&L
  mirrors direction (profits when price falls), and days-held measures from the
  sell date (the actual open leg) for a short. MTF is long-only in India, so
  its own-capital/funded-amount fields are unaffected. New `tests/positions.test.ts`
  (7 tests: long, short profit/loss, days-held, R-multiple sign, MTF untouched).
  Verified live: a disposable open short stock-option (entry 100, MTM 80, qty
  75) correctly showed invested ₹7,500 / unrealised +₹1,500 (20%) where it
  previously showed all zeros — then removed.

## v2.60.0
- **Fixed: Edit-trade dialog showed a false loss for open MTF positions.** The
  dialog never wired up the current-price field to the P&L preview, so a
  position up in price could still show "Net: -₹X" (only realized gross, always
  ₹0 pre-exit). It now shows entry cost so far and unrealized P&L (at current
  price) as separate, clearly-labeled figures for any still-open position.
- **New: Current R and Target R:R shown side by side.** Current R stays live
  (unrealised P&L ÷ risk amount, tracks the position as it moves); Target R:R is
  new — the static planned reward:risk from entry/SL/target, computed once at
  entry. Both appear on the trades table, trackers, and edit/add trade dialogs.
- **MTF own-margin % is now broker-specific, not one flat global rate.**
  `margin_config` gained a `broker` column (Dhan/Groww 25%, Zerodha 20%, per
  each broker's own MTF documentation) — threaded through position tracking,
  the accrual job, close/edit/create trade flows, the Trade Calculator, the
  broker-cost comparison report, and the /risk margin-rate editor (now one row
  per broker × segment, independently editable).
- **New: funding-type filter on the equity tracker** — All / User-funded only /
  Broker-funded (MTF) — to separate self-funded delivery positions from
  leveraged MTF ones at a glance.
- **New: Risk Amount auto-computes from the SL you set** (`|entry − SL| × qty`)
  in both the Add-trade and Edit-trade forms, while still allowing a manual
  override.
- **New: preset playbooks library** — 10 globally-recognized trading setups
  (Opening Range Breakout, VWAP reversion, trend-following, breakout-pullback,
  mean-reversion, gap-and-go, momentum, options theta-decay, earnings play,
  multi-day swing) selectable from the New Playbook dialog to pre-fill the form;
  edit anything before saving. The from-scratch custom-playbook flow is
  unchanged.
- Verified live end-to-end (broker-specific margin math, the false-loss fix,
  auto risk-amount, funding filter, preset playbooks) against a disposable test
  trade and playbook, cleaned up afterward. 393 unit tests, typecheck, lint all
  green.

## v2.50.0
- **Fixed: capital figures frozen at the original ₹13L/₹4L defaults.** Page titles,
  Cash & Ledger, and bucket-filter dropdowns had "(₹13L)"/"(₹4L)" hardcoded into
  `BUCKET_LABELS` — changing capital in Settings never touched them (now removed;
  live capital already shows correctly elsewhere on each page). A second instance of
  the same bug: the Targets → Equity position-size calculator divided by a
  hardcoded 1,300,000 instead of live `equityCapital` — now threaded through as a
  prop from the server page.
- **Fixed: R-multiple frozen at trade creation for open positions.** The tracker
  showed a value computed once when a trade was opened (net entry-cost ÷ risk),
  never updated as the position moved — a position up 1.43% could show a negative
  R. `lib/analytics/positions.ts#deriveOpenPositions` now computes R live as
  unrealised P&L ÷ risk amount.
- **Fixed: a second "MTF funded = full position value" bug**, this time in the
  position-tracker's own display logic (`positions.ts`), independent of the
  backend fix from v2.0.0 — it was silently ignoring the persisted funded amount
  and recomputing the (wrong) full-value figure for display.
- **Fixed: MTF interest day-count undercounted by one day, in three places** —
  close-trade, the daily accrual job, and broker-cost comparison all subtracted an
  extra day. Confirmed against Dhan's own MTF documentation: interest runs from
  T+1 settlement through the day before sale proceeds settle, i.e. exactly
  (sellDate − buyDate) calendar days — no "-1".
- **Corrected Zerodha's seeded pledge/unpledge fee** from ₹20 to the real ₹15+GST
  per Zerodha's own MTF calculator page. Every other rate (Dhan's interest tiers,
  Zerodha/Groww annual rates, STT/stamp/exchange/SEBI/DP) already reconciled
  exactly against a real user-supplied MTF trade log.
- **MTF input model switched to "Own capital used" as primary** (matching how a
  real MTF trade log is kept — you know what cash you put in; the broker-financed
  amount and leverage are derived), replacing the old "funded amount" field in
  both the trade form and the Trade Calculator.
- **New: close any open trade** — a "Close position" action with a live
  recomputed charges/P&L preview before confirming, for any segment (equity,
  MTF, options, futures).
- **New: edit any trade, any time** — a full editor (qty, prices, dates, SL/TSL/
  target, risk, MTF own-capital, tags, notes) for open or closed trades, reusing
  the same charges engine so edits never drift from what a fresh entry would
  compute.
- **New MTF analytics on the position tracker**: own capital deployed, ROI on
  capital % (the leveraged return your own cash actually earned), breakeven sell
  price, and a warning badge when accrued interest has eaten the entire unrealised
  gain — modeled directly on a real trader-maintained MTF log.
- Verified live end-to-end against real test positions (created, tracked, closed,
  edited, then removed) plus the existing 252-trade journal, which is untouched.
  387 unit tests, typecheck, lint and production build all green.

## v2.0.0
- **Fixed: MTF interest overcharged everywhere (real money bug).** Trade creation, the
  daily accrual job, position-close, and the Trade Calculator's default all treated an
  MTF position as 100% broker-financed — interest should only accrue on the leveraged
  portion your broker actually lends, not the full position value. New
  `defaultMtfFundedAmount()` (`lib/risk/margin.ts`, 4 tests) derives the funded amount
  from the existing configurable own-margin % (Settings → Margin, same rate the /risk
  margin gauge uses); a new `trades.mtf_funded_amount_paise` column persists it per
  trade at entry so the accrual job and close-position recompute reuse the correct
  figure instead of silently resetting to the full buy value. The live charge preview
  now applies the identical default, so what you see before saving matches what's
  saved (it previously skipped MTF interest AND the pledge charge whenever "MTF
  funded" was left blank). Verified live: a ₹1L test MTF position correctly funded at
  ₹75,000, not ₹1,00,000 — roughly 25% less interest than the old bug charged.
- **Fixed: open-trade preview showed a false loss when price was up.** The "Add open
  trade" panel only ever displayed realized P&L (always ₹0 gross pre-exit), so a
  position up in price still read as a net loss from entry charges alone. Now shows
  "Entry cost so far" (charges only) and, when a current price is entered, a separate
  "Unrealized P&L (at current price)" line — clearly not merged into the cost figure.
  Closed-trade preview is unchanged.
- Removed the "Days held (MTF)" field from the open-trade form (interest can't have
  accrued on day zero); kept for closed manual entries where an elapsed holding period
  is meaningful. Trade Calculator's "Funded ₹ (0 = full)" relabeled to "0 = auto @
  {margin}%".

## v1.50.0
- **Pre-trade limits are now advisory — the trader always has final say.** A breached
  limit no longer disables the Add-trade button: the verdict reads "Limit breached
  (you can override)" and the button flips to a red "Override & add anyway". Overridden
  breaches are still recorded in `rule_violations` and surface on the Discipline
  scorecard's breach tile — control stays with the user, accountability stays in the
  journal.
- **"Active" bucket renamed to "Trade F&O" everywhere in the UI** — nav ("Trade F&O
  Tracker", "Targets — Trade F&O"), page titles, dashboard/trades bucket filters, risk
  cockpit scope toggle, margin gauge, capital settings, cash ledger, capital-growth
  chart. Display-only: the internal bucket id stays `active` (DB rows, APIs and
  overrides are untouched). New `BUCKET_SHORT_LABELS` in `lib/domain/constants.ts`.

## v1.40.0
- **P0.1 paise migration FINISHED** — all 17 ₹-amount columns on `trades` (values, P&L,
  full charge breakdown, risk amount) now stored as INTEGER paise (migrations `0016`/`0017`,
  data converted ×100 in place and verified sum-identical on all 252 trades). A Drizzle
  `customType` exposes rupees at runtime, so no call sites changed. Per-unit price/level
  columns (avg prices, SL/TSL/target, strike, FMV) stay REAL by design.
- **Margin/SPAN tracking** (P1.2 final slice) — pure `lib/risk/margin.ts` (7 tests): long
  options = premium paid; short options = rate% × notional (spot ?? strike); futures/intraday
  = rate% × current value; MTF/delivery = rate% × invested. New editable `margin_config`
  rate table (migration `0018`, seeded approximations) + "Margin estimate" panel with
  per-bucket utilisation gauges on /risk.
- **IND-5 AIS / Form 26AS reconciliation** — pure `lib/analytics/ais.ts` (8 tests): tolerant
  paste parser (dividend / sale SFT-18 / purchase SFT-17 / interest; FY labels or dates;
  ₹-grouped amounts) + reconciliation of AIS dividends (per company+FY, alias-resolved,
  incl. TDS) and per-FY sale/purchase consideration (trades + IPO allotments/exits) with
  matched / MISMATCH / not-in-journal / not-in-AIS statuses, tolerance max(₹10, 0.5%).
  New /reports/ais screen (nav "AIS Reconcile"), stateless `/api/ais`.
- **P2.1 broker-API auto-import (Kite slice)** — first `ApiImportSource` implementation:
  `lib/import/api/kite.ts` (5 tests) pulls today's executions from Zerodha Kite Connect,
  aggregates per symbol+product (earliest-buy/latest-sell dates, MIS→intraday, CNC→delivery,
  MTF→mtf hints) and feeds the unchanged preview→commit pipeline. "Connect broker" card on
  /import; credentials in new `broker_connections` table (migration `0020`, plaintext local,
  stated in UI; Kite tokens expire daily).
- **Trade attachments** (P2.4 completion) — chart screenshots per trade: `trade_attachments`
  table (migration `0019`) + files under `<data-dir>/attachments/`, upload/gallery/delete in
  the journal dialog, streaming via `/api/trades/attachments` (images only, 8 MB cap,
  path-confined, audited). Backup screen notes attachments are outside the JSON backup.
- **MAE/MFE per trade** — pure `lib/analytics/mae-mfe.ts` (5 tests) computes max adverse /
  favorable excursion + %-of-MFE captured from `price_history` EOD bars for closed dated
  trades; card with coverage badges on /reports/edge.
- **Discipline breach tile** (P1.4 follow-up) — `breachReport()` in discipline.ts (4 tests)
  rolls up `rule_violations` saved at entry time; "Entry-time limit breaches" card on
  /reports/discipline showing per-rule counts and closed net P&L.
- **Zero-dependency installer** — `build-desktop.mjs` now bundles the building machine's
  Node runtime (+ LICENSE) into `desktop-dist/node/`; the Tauri shell prefers the bundled
  binary and falls back to system `node` for older bundles. Target machines no longer need
  Node installed (cargo check verified; rebuild the installer to ship it).

## v1.10.0
- Option Greeks: Black-Scholes delta/gamma/theta/vega per open option position + a
  portfolio aggregator (`lib/analytics/greeks.ts`), scaled by quantity and signed for
  direction (short flips gamma/vega negative, theta positive). New `trades.implied_vol`
  column, settable per position via the risk-edit dialog; falls back to a flat 20%
  estimate when unset. New "Option Greeks" panel on Portfolio Risk.

## v1.9.0
- F&O trade entry upgrade: an Equity/F&O mode toggle in the manual trade form —
  Underlying, Option/Future, Strike, CE/PE, Direction (Buy/Sell), Expiry with a live
  DTE badge, Lot size, Lots, Entry/Exit premium, Strategy.
- Short (sell-to-open) position support fixed across the app: `isOpen` detection,
  the risk/exposure engine, the close/cover flow, and the pre-trade risk-edit routes
  were long-only; a written CE/PE was previously invisible to portfolio risk.
- Real sector data (via an external market-data lookup) populated for held positions,
  correcting earlier manual-entry mistakes in the instruments master.

## v1.8.0
- P1.3 market-data foundation: `instruments` security master (symbol/sector/ISIN/lot
  size) and `price_history` (EOD OHLC, built automatically from bhavcopy imports).
- Sector concentration panel on Portfolio Risk (HHI, top-sector %, classified %).

## v1.7.0
- P1.1 finished: time-weighted return (TWR) and benchmark alpha/beta vs an index
  (NIFTY), completing the performance analytics suite alongside the existing
  Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar/XIRR.
- P1.4 pre-trade limits engine: per-trade risk cap, daily-loss stop, max-open,
  max-trades/day, and concentration checks — live pass/warn/block before saving a
  trade, plus a what-if panel on Portfolio Risk.

## v1.6.0
- Version-sync-only bump (no feature).

## v1.5.0 and earlier
- Foundational build: money-as-paise core, cash/fund-flow ledger, append-only audit
  log, backup/restore, quant performance analytics (Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar/XIRR),
  option strategy recognition + payoff diagrams, physical-settlement tracker,
  F&O ban/ASM surveillance, tax-loss harvesting, advance-tax planner, broker-cost
  comparison, bhavcopy auto-MTM, symbol-alias map, and the trade calculator.
  See `docs/INSTITUTIONAL_GRADE_ROADMAP.md` for full detail on each.
